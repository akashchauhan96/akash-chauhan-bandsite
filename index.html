                The Bees Knees is a pop rock band originating from San
                Francisco, California. The band consists of lead vocalist Bryan
                Teddy, guitarist Mack Tolkens, guitarist Andrew Green, bassist
                Kent Zulkee and drummer Freddie Fischer. The band achieved its
                first commercial success as an unsigned act, drawing attention
                from manager Cam Adams. Having worked with other popular acts
                (The Elephant In The Room, One Trick Pony, The Cat's Meow),
                Adams was confident the band could succeed even further, pushing
                them to sign with Magenta Records.
              </p>
              <p class="about__band-description-2">
                From there, the band has soared, gaining international
                recognition and ranking in the top 10 on the Poster Charts. New
                fans immediately fell in love with the band's original and
                organic attitude, solidifying their place as one of the hottest
                and fastest up and coming acts of this century. Fans
                affectionately refer to themselves as “The Hive” and are drawn
                to their candid and authentic performances on stage. Looking
                forward to touring in the future, The Bees Knees are currently
                recording their second studio album, looking to be released in
                late 2021.
